Headquartered in Duluth, Minnesota, Essentia Health combines the strengths and talents of over 13,000 employees, including more than 2,000 providers (physicians and advanced practitioners) in more than 56 specialties, who serve our patients and communities through the mission of being called to make a healthy difference in people’s lives.\n\nEssentia Health, which includes many Catholic facilities, is guided by the values of Quality, Hospitality, Respect, Joy, Justice, Stewardship and Teamwork. The organization delivers on its mission of making a healthy difference in people’s lives in 13 hospitals, approximately 70 clinics, six long-term care facilities, three assisted living facilities, three independent living facilities, several rehabilitation centers, five ambulance services, one research institute, home health services and one durable medical equipment company.  A key strategy of the System is to collaborate with community-based health care organizations where local and regional identity is preserved, yet supported by the knowledge, experience and resources of a strong, values-oriented organization.\n\nEssentia serves an area with a population of more than 1 million people. In 2020, Essentia had over 37,000 hospital patient discharges, approximately 630,000 outpatient visits and more than 1.4 million clinic patient encounters.

The museum houses a world-class collection of more than 90,000 works of art, representing artistic traditions spanning 5,000 years. Mia is especially recognized for its collection of Asian art, which comprises some 16,800 objects, ranging from ancient pottery and bronzes to works by contemporary artists, with nearly every Asian culture represented, including: China, Japan, India, Himalayas, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Korea. Areas of particular depth include the arts of China and Japan. The museum’s commitment to Asian art is evident from the gallery space devoted to its display. At present, Asian art occupies 20 percent (32,200 sq. ft.) of the museum’s total gallery space (161,000 sq. ft.). Four curators oversee the presentation and growth of the collection.\nMia’s original neoclassical building, a landmark of downtown Minneapolis, designed by the preeminent New York firm McKim, Mead and White, first opened its doors in 1915. The museum expanded in 1974 with an addition designed by the late Japanese architect Kenzo Tange. In June 2006, the museum unveiled a new wing designed by Michael Graves. \nWith its free admissions policy, Mia is an invaluable resource to its audiences, welcoming visitors of all ages each year to enjoy the wonder and beauty of art. \nDuring the 2020 fiscal year, 416,471 people visited Mia, with an additional 1 million “virtual visitors” exploring the museum’s collections and exhibitions via its award-winning Web site, artsmia.org, and reaching an additional 25.8 million via Mia’s social media sites, including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram, and Flickr.

It is known for award-winning recordings and international touring, as well as for notable educational engagement programs and a commitment to new orchestral repertoire. Founded as the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra, the ensemble gave its inaugural performance on November 5, 1903, six weeks before the Wright brothers made their unprecedented airplane flight. The ensemble typically presents nearly 175 programs annually, primarily at its home venue of Orchestra Hall in downtown Minneapolis.
