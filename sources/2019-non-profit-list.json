Headquartered in Duluth, Minn., Essentia Health combines the strengths and talents of 14,500 employees, including more than 2,100 providers in more than 55 specialties, who serve our patients and communities through the mission of being called to make a healthy difference in people’s lives.\n\nEssentia Health, which includes many Catholic facilities, is guided by the values of Quality, Hospitality, Respect, Joy, Justice, Stewardship and Teamwork. The organization delivers on its promise to be “Here With You” in 15 hospitals, more than 70 clinics, six skilled nursing facilities, three assisted living facilities, three independent living facilities and several rehabilitation centers, six ambulance services, one research institute, home health services and one Durable Medical Equipment company.

APMG changed the recurring term of its Sustaining Membership agreement from annual to monthly; now we are recording revenue from Sustainers as it is received each month instead of recording the total amount of an annual pledge from Sustainers. This change was necessary to support new gift processing technology and to meet the changing philanthropic expectations of our donors.\n\nFrom a financial reporting perspective, this change is most visible in the Consolidated Statement of Activities (page 4 of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements) and Schedule of Operating Fund and Long-term Activities (page 27 of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements), which caused a one-time $11,671,000 decrease in Individual Gifts and Membership support and Change in Net Assets line items. More information about the change is included in footnote 2 of the report (page 10 of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements). \n\nWhile this change caused a one-time reduction in revenue recorded in fiscal year 2018, it did not in any way change the actual level of support from Sustainers or affect the amount of cash flow provided by our Sustaining Members. Revenues will substantially recover in fiscal year 2019 with this change now fully implemented.\n","id":4922,"inputsource":"Automatically imported from 2018 survey.","modified_date":"2018-12-03T08:40:49.510000","programservicerevenue":22026000,"publishyear":2018,"resource_uri":"/data-ui/api/v01/nonprofit_finances/4922/","revenue":134704000,"source":"Consolidated financial statement"}],"officers":[{"coid":"/data-ui/api/v01/company/363503764/","created_date":"2018-05-08T09:55:49.840460","director":0,"dropped":0,"first":"Mark","gender":"M","id":11701,"last":"Alfuth","modified_date":"2018-05-08T09:55:50.716532","resource_uri":"/data-ui/api/v01/officer/11701/","title":"CFO","hasImage":false},{"coid":"/data-ui/api/v01/company/363503764/","created_date":"2018-05-08T09:55:49.840460","director":0,"dropped":0,"first":"William","gender":"M","id":9630,"last":"Kling","modified_date":"2018-05-08T09:55:50.716532","resource_uri":"/data-ui/api/v01/officer/9630/","title":"Pres., CEO","hasImage":false},{"coid":"/data-ui/api/v01/company/363503764/","created_date":"2018-05-08T09:55:49.840460","director":0,"dropped":0,"first":"Jon","gender":"M","id":11733,"last":"McTaggart","modified_date":"2020-01-06T06:40:28.589000","nonprofit_salaries":[{"added":"2019-12-20","benefit":24306,"bonus":193427,"ceo":1,"created_date":"2019-12-20T06:30:58.123000","deferred":17550,"fiscalyearend":"2019-06-30","id":6905,"modified_date":"2020-01-06T06:40:28.797000","officerid":{"coid":{"added":"2017-11-21","address1":"480 Cedar St","alpha":"American Public","category":"Other","city":"Saint Paul","class_field":"1","coid":"363503764","companyhistory":"Minnesota Communication Group changed its name to American Public Media Group in 2001.

Based in St. Paul, Minnesota, with an additional seminary location in San Diego, California, Bethel offers bachelors, masters, and doctoral degrees in approximately 100 relevant fields. Weve been a leader and model in Christian higher education since 1871. For generations, our fusion of evangelical faith with top-ranked academics has transformed women and men, preparing them for unique callings in the kingdom of God. A Bethel education prepares students to follow their dreams, do work that matters, and live with purpose so they can make a difference in their careers, their communities, and our world. We are a community of gracious servants, compassionate friends, and diligent scholars who are confident in our abilities and humble in our faith. Popular programs for undergraduates include business, nursing, education, communication studies, and psychology. Bethel's B.S. in biokinetics meets a growing need in the marketplace and features the Exercise Medicine and Prevention Center, giving students hands-on laboratory experience. Bethel is highly ranked nationally for percentage of students participating in study abroad programs, with more than 30 options for off-campus study.

The museum houses a world-class collection of more than 90,000 works of art, representing artistic traditions spanning 5,000 years. Mia is especially recognized for its collection of Asian art, which comprises some 16,800 objects, ranging from ancient pottery and bronzes to works by contemporary artists, with nearly every Asian culture represented, including: China, Japan, India, Himalayas, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Korea. Areas of particular depth include the arts of China and Japan. The museum’s commitment to Asian art is evident from the gallery space devoted to its display. At present, Asian art occupies 20 percent (32,200 sq. ft.) of the museum’s total gallery space (161,000 sq. ft.). Four curators oversee the presentation and growth of the collection.\nMia’s original neoclassical building, a landmark of downtown Minneapolis, designed by the preeminent New York firm McKim, Mead and White, first opened its doors in 1915. The museum expanded in 1974 with an addition designed by the late Japanese architect Kenzo Tange. In June 2006, the museum unveiled a new wing designed by Michael Graves.

Four curators oversee the presentation and growth of the collection.\nMia’s original neoclassical building, a landmark of downtown Minneapolis, designed by the preeminent New York firm McKim, Mead and White, first opened its doors in 1915. The museum expanded in 1974 with an addition designed by the late Japanese architect Kenzo Tange. In June 2006, the museum unveiled a new wing designed by Michael Graves. In 2017, Mia announced that it had hired David Chipperfield Architects, the internationally renowned architectural firm, to create a master plan for the museum. The plan will be the first step in Mia’s long-term strategy to enhance visitor experience and expand community access to the museum.\nWith its free admissions policy, Mia is an invaluable resource to its audiences, welcoming approximately 700,000 visitors of all ages each year to enjoy the wonder and beauty of art. \nDuring the 2019 fiscal year, 779,973 people visited Mia, with an additional 2.7 million “virtual visitors” exploring the museum’s collections and exhibitions via its award-winning Web site, www. artsmia.org, and reaching an additional 29.4 million via Mia’s social media sites, including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram, and Flickr. Mia had 52,102 members during the fiscal year.\n","enteredby":"2016","founded":1915,"fymonth":6,"irsno":"410693915","modified_date":"2020-01-06T06:41:22.928000","name":"The Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts","phone":"6128703064","resource_uri":"/data-ui/api/v01/company/410693915/","seealso":"Minneapolis Institute of Arts","shortdesc":"Operates the Minneapolis Institute of Art.","state":"MN","www":"www.artsmia.org","zip":"55404"},"created_date":"2018-05-08T09:55:49.840460","director":0,"dropped":0,"first":"Kaywin","gender":"F","id":11635,"last":"Feldman","modified_date":"2020-01-06T06:41:23.335000","resource_uri":"/data-ui/api/v01/officer/11635/","title":"former director and president"},"other":51474,"publishyear":2019,"salary":526010,"title":"former director and president","total":612572}},"rankPrevious":101,"rank":86},{"added":"2018-02-06","address1":"401 93rd Ave NW","alpha":"Feed My Starving","category":"Social services","city":"Coon Rapids","class_field":"5","coid":"411601449","companyhistory":"Richard Proudfit founded the organziation in 1987 to develop and distribute an effective and nutritous meal kit for improvished children around the world.","companytype":"Charity ss","contact":"Dan Stennes-Rogness","contactemail":"drogness@fmsc.org","contactphone":"763-231-0157","created_date":"2018-05-08T09:55:41.565487","description":"Feed My Starving Children is a Christian non-profit organization committed to feeding God's starving children hungry in body and spirit.

We believe that all progress starts with nutrition - it allows children to develop to their full potential. Volunteers of all ages join us and turn hunger into hope with their own two hands by hand-packing special meal formulas scientifically designed to meet the needs of severely malnourished children, reverse the effects of malnutrition and prevent it in the future. The meals are then shipped to an exceptional network of missions and humanitarian organizations located in nearly 70 countries around the world, and are used by schools, orphanages, clinics and feeding programs. We currently operate out of eight permanent sites: Coon Rapids, Eagan and Chanhassen, Minnesota; Aurora, Libertyville and Schaumburg, Illinois; Mesa, Arizona; and Dallas, Texas. \nWe also offer the option to host a MobilePack, which gives churches, schools, businesses and other organizations (located anywhere in the continental United States) the chance to sponsor a packing event with FMSC and help raise awareness in their own communities.

Due to the current state of malnutrition worldwide, one out of four children is \"stunted\" - they do not receive enough essential nutrients to grow healthy, and as a result, brain development comes to a halt. We believe that all progress starts with nutrition - it allows children to develop to their full potential. Volunteers of all ages join us and turn hunger into hope with their own two hands by hand-packing special meal formulas scientifically designed to meet the needs of severely malnourished children, reverse the effects of malnutrition and prevent it in the future. The meals are then shipped to an exceptional network of missions and humanitarian organizations located in nearly 70 countries around the world, and are used by schools, orphanages, clinics and feeding programs. We currently operate out of eight permanent sites: Coon Rapids, Eagan and Chanhassen, Minnesota; Aurora, Libertyville and Schaumburg, Illinois; Mesa, Arizona; and Dallas, Texas. \nWe also offer the option to host a MobilePack, which gives churches, schools, businesses and other organizations (located anywhere in the continental United States) the chance to sponsor a packing event with FMSC and help raise awareness in their own communities. The impact FMSC has through its volunteers is dynamic - the latest fiscal year ended February 2018, with 1,221,900 volunteers packing 333 million meals-our largest year yet! The goal of FMSC is to meet the needs of those who are starving now, so they can meet their own needs in the future. We have received a four-star rating from Charity Navigator for thirteen consecutive years, and 99.8% of our meals have successfully reached their intended recipients. \n","founded":1987,"fymonth":2,"irsno":"411601449","modified_date":"2020-01-06T06:41:23.944000","name":"Feed My Starving Children","phone":"7635042919","resource_uri":"/data-ui/api/v01/company/411601449/","shortdesc":"Feed My Starving Children is a Christian nonprofit dedicated to seeing every child and person around the world healthy, nourished and whole in body and spirit.

Recognizing the critical need for solid science resources in our rapidly-changing world, the museum inspires science learning, break down barriers to science achievement, and create space for conversations that foster understanding. \n\nThe museum’s reach extends well beyond its location in downtown Saint Paul. With its engaging exhibits, giant screen films, and unique special events, the museum offers science fun and learning for visitors of all ages. It produces exhibits, films, and programs for museums around the world, and it has innovative initiatives underway to help all people see themselves in science. \n\nThe Science Museum is an active research institution.
